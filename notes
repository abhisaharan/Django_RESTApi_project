Flow to get started with RestAPI Django
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/

-> pip install djangorestframework
-> add our 'rest_framework' app to INSTALLED_APPS
-> create a model to work with in a new application(ex: snippets)
-> Create a file in the snippets directory named serializers.py
-> Using ModelSerializers class helps reduces code like we used ModelForm class instead of Form.
        It's important to remember that ModelSerializer classes don't do anything particularly magical, they are simply a shortcut for creating serializer classes:

            An automatically determined set of fields.
            Simple default implementations for the create() and update() methods.
-> Create views and add url to snippets/urls.py
-> Many ways of creating views for serializers are 'class based views(*when using this make sure to modify snippets/urls.py ) and 'mixins' and 'generic class based views'

-> We can test our API using curl or httpie. Httpie is a user friendly http client that's written in Python. Let's install that.
    pip install httpie
