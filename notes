Flow to get started with RestAPI Django
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/

-> pip install djangorestframework
-> add our 'rest_framework' app to INSTALLED_APPS
-> create a model to work with in a new application(ex: snippets)
-> Create a file in the snippets directory named serializers.py and create serializer class.
-> Using ModelSerializers class helps reduces code like we used ModelForm class instead of Form.
        It's important to remember that ModelSerializer classes don't do anything particularly magical, they are simply a shortcut for creating serializer classes:

            An automatically determined set of fields.
            Simple default implementations for the create() and update() methods.
-> Create views and add url to snippets/urls.py
-> Many ways of creating views for serializers are 'class based views(*when using this make sure to modify snippets/urls.py ) and 'mixins' and 'generic class based views'

-> We can test our API using curl or httpie. Httpie is a user friendly http client that's written in Python. Let's install that.
    pip install httpie


-----working with serializer- data to JSON and serialization i.e parse JSON to python native data types
import model, serilizer and JSONRenderer (to convert to json) and JSONParser (to convert back to python native datatype)
Ex:
snippet = Snippet(name = "Abhi")    #Snippet is database model we created
snippet.save                        # we created model instance

serializer = SnippetSerializer(snippet)
serializer.data                     # model instance into Python native datatypes.

Then we render to JSON

content = JSONRenderer().render(serializer.data)
content                             # render the data into json


DESERILIZATION - first we parse a stream into python native datatype
from django.utils.six import BytesIO
stream = BytesIO(content)
data = JSONParser().parse(stream)
.then we restore those native datatypes into a fully populated object instance.
serializer = SnippetSerializer(data=data)
serializer.is_valid()
# to check True
serializer.validated_data
serializer.save()






********to remove database************
-> command line:
    rm -f tmp.db db.sqlite3
    rm -r snippets/migrations
